Hello, my name is Katherine Rizzo, and I am a dedicated nursing professional with over nine years of diverse experience in healthcare. I began my journey in nursing after graduating with a 
                Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) from California State University, Dominguez Hills.<br>
                <br>

               Passionate about advancing my expertise and leadership in nursing, I am currently pursuing a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) degree at the same institution.
               My career started in telemetry, where I spent four years honing my skills in monitoring and analyzing patients' critical data. In pursuit of broader clinical experience, I transitioned to 
               the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. 
               For the past five years, I have been a Clinical Nurse III, a role that demands both acute clinical judgment and exceptional patient care in a fast-paced environment.
               <br>
               <br>
               I hold a Certification in Critical Care Nursing (CCRN) for adults, which underlines my commitment to maintaining the highest standards of care in critical care settings.
                I am dedicated to improving patient outcomes through evidence-based practice and am deeply committed to the well-being of my patients and their families.
