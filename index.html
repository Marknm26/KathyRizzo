                <p>Hello, my name is Katherine Rizzo, and I am a dedicated nursing professional with over nine years of diverse experience in healthcare. I began my journey in nursing after graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) from California State University, Dominguez Hills.<br><br>
                   Passionate about advancing my expertise and leadership in nursing, I am currently pursuing a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) degree at the same institution.
                   My career started in telemetry, where I spent four years honing my skills in monitoring and analyzing patients' critical data. In pursuit of broader clinical experience, I transitioned to 
                   the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. 
                   For the past five years, I have been a Clinical Nurse III, a role that demands both acute clinical judgment and exceptional patient care in a fast-paced environment.
